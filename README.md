# GAN Convergence

Code for the experiments in "Convergence Properties of Generative Adversarial Networks".

The code comes with basic functionalities in experimenting with different GAN objectives, including non-saturating GAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, WGAN-LP and WGAN with simple gradient penalties. The implemented experiments include DiracGAN, learning intervalls in 1D and different manifolds in 2D.
