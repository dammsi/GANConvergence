# GAN Convergence

Code for the experiments in "Convergence Properties of Generative Adversarial Networks".

We implemented the following experiments in PyTorch to explore different techniques fostering GAN convergence. 
The code base covers different GAN objectives including non-saturating GAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, WGAN-LP and WGAN with a simple gradient regularization. 
The learning scenarios cover the DiracGAN, learning intervalls in 1D and different manifolds in 2D.
